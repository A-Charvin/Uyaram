  Point Cloud → Heightmap  ·  Malayalam: Uyaram = Height
```

**Uyaram** converts LiDAR point clouds (`.las` / `.laz`) into georeferenced heightmap GeoTIFFs optimised for import into Blender as displacement textures. It is designed for producing high-fidelity clay-style 3D relief renders of urban terrain.

---

## What It Does

- Reads one or more `.las` / `.laz` files from a folder
- Calculates a **global coordinate offset** across all tiles so they sit flush together near Blender's world origin
- **Optional classification filter**: exclude noise, water, or unclassified points when your data is properly tagged
- Applies a **coordinate transformation** to shift real-world UTM coordinates to local origin
- Outputs a **32-bit float GeoTIFF heightmap** per tile using PDAL's GDAL writer at maximum point height per cell
- **Real-time PDAL output streaming**: watch processing progress live in the log
- Prints the exact **Midlevel** and **Strength** values to enter in Blender's Displace modifier for each tile

---

## Why Heightmaps Instead of Meshes

Converting LiDAR directly to a 3D mesh (via Poisson reconstruction or similar) produces hundreds of millions of triangles for urban areas - Blender cannot handle this efficiently. Uyaram instead generates a **high-resolution 32-bit float displacement texture**. In Blender this is paired with a simple subdivided plane and a Displace modifier, keeping geometry counts low while retaining full elevation fidelity including rooftop detail, antennas, and building edge definition.

## Requirements

| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Python 3.8+ | Runtime | [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) |
| QGIS | Software | https://qgis.org/download/ |
| laspy[lazrs] | Python package | Auto-installed on first run |
| PDAL | System binary | Must be installed separately - see below |

**Note**: Uyaram no longer requires `numpy`, `osgeo`, or `gdal` Python packages. All geospatial processing is handled by QGIS-bundled CLI tools.

### Getting PDAL

PDAL is a system-level tool and cannot be auto-installed. The easiest route on Windows is to install **QGIS** - it bundles a full PDAL installation automatically.

- **QGIS (recommended):** [qgis.org/download](https://qgis.org/download/) - installs PDAL to `C:\Program Files\QGIS x.x\bin\pdal.exe`
- **PDAL standalone:** [pdal.io/en/latest/download.html](https://pdal.io/en/latest/download.html)
- **Conda:** `conda install -c conda-forge pdal`

Uyaram will automatically search common PDAL install locations on startup. If found, it uses the detected path silently. If not found, it presents download links directly in the startup window.

---

## Installation

No pip install required. Just download and run.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/A-Charvin/Uyaram.git
cd Uyaram
python Uyaram.py
```

On first run Uyaram will:
1. Check for `laspy` - install it automatically via pip if missing
2. Search for a PDAL binary - report where it was found or guide you to install it
3. Launch the main interface once all dependencies are confirmed

---

## Usage

### GUI

```bash
python Uyaram.py
```

1. **Source Folder** - browse to or type the path of a folder containing `.las` or `.laz` files
2. **Output Folder** - optionally set a different output location
   - Leave blank → heightmaps are written alongside the source files
   - Type a path that doesn't exist → Uyaram creates the folder automatically
3. **Resolution** - set the output pixel size in metres per pixel (default: `0.5`)
   - `0.5` - high detail, good for urban areas up to ~2km²
   - `1.0` - medium detail, faster, suitable for larger extents
   - `2.0` - coarse, fast, large area overviews
4. **Classification Filter** (optional) - click to expand and exclude specific LiDAR classes:
   - **Noise** (classes 7, 18): removes specular reflections and outliers
   - **Water** (class 9): removes water surface returns and reflections
   - **Unclassified** (class 1): removes points without classification tags
   - *Tip: If your data has no classifications, leave all classes enabled — no filter step is added to the pipeline*
5. **Mosaic output** (optional) - merge all tile heightmaps into a single GeoTIFF after processing
6. Click **▶ Process Files**

### Command Line (headless)

For scripted or server workflows, the core pipeline logic can be run without the GUI:

```bash
python Uyaram.py --nogui --source /path/to/laz --output /path/to/output --resolution 0.5
```

> Note: `--nogui` mode is on the roadmap. Currently GUI mode is required.

---

## Output Files

For each input `.laz` file, Uyaram produces:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `filename_heightmap.tif` | 32-bit float GeoTIFF, coordinate-shifted to local origin, DEFLATE compressed, **NoData = -2.0** |

The GeoTIFF retains full spatial metadata (projection, geotransform) so it can be loaded back into QGIS or ArcGIS Pro for verification.

**Why NoData = -2.0?**  
After the Z-shift, real ground equals `0.0`. Setting NoData to `-2.0` keeps empty cells visually distinct from terrain while avoiding Blender displacement artifacts. The slight negative offset is negligible in renders but prevents void blending.

---

## Using the Output in Blender

Uyaram prints the exact values to use in Blender's Displace modifier for each tile. Here is the full setup:

### 1. Import with BlenderGIS

Install the [BlenderGIS addon](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS), then:

```
GIS → Import → Georeferenced Raster
```

Select your `_heightmap.tif`. In the import options set **Mode** to `DEM as Displacement Texture`.
Set Subdivision to `Subsurf`

### 2. Modifier setting

On each tile Set the Render amount to 11 or higher so that the final render will have full detail.
Can also set Levels Viewport to higher one too if the system can handle it without issues.

### 3. Clay Material

In Material Properties → New material (Principled BSDF):

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Base Color | R: 0.85  G: 0.84  B: 0.82 |
| Roughness | 0.9 |
| Specular IOR Level | 0.0 |
| Metallic | 0.0 |
| **Shade Flat** | ✅ (do not use Shade Smooth) |

### 4. Lighting

Add a Sun lamp (`Shift+A → Light → Sun`):

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Rotation X | 55° |
| Rotation Z | 315° (northwest - cartographic convention) |
| Strength | 4.0 |
| Angle | 1.5° *(sharper shadows reveal fine LiDAR detail)* |

(Optional) Enable **Ambient Occlusion** in Render Properties: 
- Distance: `1.5m` *(adjust to match your tile scale)*
- Factor: `0.5`

### 5. Camera
- Select one of the Tiles and Go to GIS -> Camera -> Georender
- Change dimenstions and Position to match your area

### 6. Render

- Engine: **Cycles** (not EEVEE)
- Device: GPU Compute
- Samples: `128` *(increase to 256 only if noise persists in deep shadows)*
- Resolution: `4096 × 4096` or higher for zoom-ready output
- Enable denoising

## Handling Water Reflections & Noise

If your heightmap shows water reflections or noise artifacts:

### Option 1: Classification Filter (If Data is Classified)
- Enable the Classification Filter in Uyaram
- Uncheck `#1 Unclassified`,`#9 Water`, `#7 Low Noise`, `#18 High Noise`
- Process as normal

### Option 2: Intensity Filtering (If Unclassified)
Water reflections often have extreme intensity values. Add this to your pipeline (advanced):

```python
# In Uyaram.py, add to pipeline_steps:
{
    "type": "filters.range",
    "limits": "Intensity[1000:50000]"  # Adjust thresholds based on your data
}
```

Typical intensity ranges:
- **Water**: Often `< 500` or `> 60000` (saturated)
- **Ground/Buildings**: `1000–40000`

### Option 3: Post-Process in Blender
If PDAL filtering doesn't fully remove artifacts:
1. In Blender, add a **Mask modifier** or use **Vertex Groups**
2. Paint mask over water areas
3. Set masked vertices to Z=0 or delete them

---

## Multi-Tile Datasets

Uyaram handles multiple tiles automatically. It calculates a **single global offset** from the average centre of all tile bounding boxes, then applies that same offset to every tile. This ensures all tiles share a common local origin and sit flush against each other in Blender without gaps or overlaps.

Import all tile heightmaps into Blender - they will align correctly because they share the same coordinate shift.

## Troubleshooting

**PDAL not found after installing QGIS**
- Restart Uyaram after installing QGIS
- Use the **Installed - retry** button in the startup checker
- If still not found, locate `pdal.exe` manually (usually in `C:\Program Files\QGIS x.x\bin\`) and add it to your system PATH

**Terrain appears flat in Blender**
- Ensure Subdivision Surface is above Displace in the modifier stack
- Set Midlevel to the value printed by Uyaram (not the default 0.5)
- Increase Strength - try 3× exaggeration first
- Verify **Color Space** is set to `Non-Color` on the displacement texture

**Terrain floating above ground or extending downward**
- Midlevel is the key - use the exact value printed in the Uyaram log
- The output GeoTIFF uses `NoData = -2.0`; Blender reads this as a slight downward offset. If you see extreme downward spikes, ensure you are using the latest Uyaram version.

**Tiles have gaps between them**
- This should not happen with Uyaram's global offset approach
- Verify all tiles were processed in the same Uyaram batch (not separate runs)
- Separate runs recalculate the global offset from only the files present - always process all tiles together in one batch

**Output GeoTIFF has 0,0,0 dimensions in BlenderGIS**
- Do not post-process the heightmap with external tools after Uyaram generates it - this can corrupt the GeoTransform metadata
- Use the raw `_heightmap.tif` output directly

**Blender crashes on Subdivision**
- For 1km tiles at 0.5m resolution, do not exceed Subdivision Render Level 2
- Use the **Exact Vertex Mapping** method (1999 cuts) for crash-proof, interpolation-free results
- Ensure your GPU has sufficient VRAM (8GB+ recommended for large tiles)
